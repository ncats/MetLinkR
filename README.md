MetLinkR is an R package for automated cross-linking of metabolite identities across datasets. It relies on [RefMet](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/databases/refmet/index.php) and [RaMP-DB](https://rampdb.nih.gov/) to standardize names and find cross-database links.

You'll need to install the RaMP package with the following code:

```
devtools::install_github("ncats/RaMP-DB")
```

You can install metLinkR by running:

```
devtools::install_github("ncats/MetLinkR")
```

The manuscript for metLinkR is currently in preparation. See our vignette [here](https://github.com/ncats/MetLinkR/blob/gh-pages/Vignette.Rmd).
